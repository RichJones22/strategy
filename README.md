## Welcome

The **main.cpp** file in this repository illustrates how to implement the Strategy Design Pattern.

This program was created using **Code::Blocks**, which can be found at **www.codeblocks.org**

To use the program, just run the program.  If you are unfamiliar with Object Oriented polymorphic behavior, run the program via the debugger, placing a watch on "(Logger\*)log".  In this way you can see, at runtime, how the Logger\* type is transformed into one of the other subclass types.
